This pipeline consists of 8 steps that need to be followed in order to successfully build and publish a multiarchitecture Docker image. The following sections describe each step in detail.

## Step 1: Checkout code

This step allows you to checkout the code from the repository that you will be working with in the pipeline. It is important to have the code locally in order to perform the necessary operations.

## Step 2: Buildx set-up

Before you can proceed with the multiarchitecture build, you need to set up Buildx. Buildx is a tool that enables multiarchitecture builds using QEMU. This step ensures that Buildx is properly installed and configured.

## Step 3: Docker Setup QEMU

QEMU is a tool that is required for multiplatform builds. This step installs QEMU, which is necessary for building a multiarchitecture Docker image.

## Step 4: Setup Gradle

This project is built using Gradle, so it is important to set up Gradle as part of the pipeline. This step ensures that Gradle is installed and ready to use for the build process.

## Step 5: Run build with Gradle Wrapper

The build process for this project is executed using the Gradle Wrapper. This step runs the build command using the Gradle Wrapper, which will compile the code and generate the necessary artifacts.

## Step 6: Login to DockerHub

To publish the built image, you need to log in to DockerHub. This step prompts for the necessary credentials and ensures that you are authenticated to push the image to the remote repository.

## Step 7: Build and push

This step builds the Docker image using the artifacts generated in the previous steps. The built image is then pushed to the remote repository specified in the pipeline configuration. Image built in this step has tag 'multiplatform'

## Conclusion

By following these 8 steps, you can successfully build and publish a multiarchitecture Docker image for this project.
